            Cocoa is a handsome brown boy with a soft coat and an even softer heart. At 3 years old, 
            he’s the perfect mix of mellow and playful. He enjoys relaxed walks, quiet moments, and 
            quality time with his humans. Cocoa has a calm, friendly nature and quickly forms strong 
            bonds with those around him. If you're looking for a loyal, easygoing companion who’s as 
            sweet as his name, Cocoa is ready to meet you!

            Bear is a stunning black and tan Pomsky (husky and pomeranian mix) with a calm and gentle 
            personality. At 2 years old, he’s past the puppy stage and enjoys a more laid-back 
            lifestyle—perfect for cozy evenings and leisurely walks. Bear loves cuddles, quiet time, 
            and being close to his people. While he still enjoys playtime, he’s not overly hyper and 
            would do great in a relaxed home environment. If you’re looking for a sweet, low-key 
            companion with a loving heart, Bear is the one for you.

        <p>
          Adopting through this site was the best decision we’ve made. Cocoa is gentle, 
          affectionate, and everything we were looking for in a companion.
